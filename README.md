# Building a Content Based Movie Recommendation System

<h2>What is a Recommendation System ? </h2>
<h4>At some point each one of us must have wondered where all the recommendations that Netflix, Amazon, Google give us, come from. We often rate products on the internet and all the preferences we express and data we share (explicitly or not), are used by recommender systems to generate, in fact, recommendations. The two main types of recommender systems are either collaborative or content-based filters: these two names are pretty self-explanatory, but letâ€™s look at a couple of examples to better understand the differences between them. I will use movies as an example (because if I could, I would be watching movies/tv shows all the time), but keep in mind that this type of process can be applied for any kind of product you watch, listen to, buy, and so on. </h4>

# Content-based filters
<h4>This type of filter does not involve other users if not ourselves. Based on what we like, the algorithm will simply pick items with similar content to recommend us.</h4>
<h4>In this case there will be less diversity in the recommendations For example, Netflix recommends us the similar movies to the movie we recently watched.Similarly, Youtube also recommends us similar videos to the videos in our watch history.</h4>
